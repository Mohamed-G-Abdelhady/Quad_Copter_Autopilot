# Quad_Copter_Autopilot
Quad Copter Autopilot coded on Arduino board with off-shelf sensors

These codes test different types of controllers equations flying Quad-Copter. Research was on modelling and analysis dynamics of Quad-Copter using simulation software, then Design and implement control algorithm on embedded system. I succeeded to have a flying model with good performance. this Video for the Model in the middle of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMHRFjNgng 



Hardware:
